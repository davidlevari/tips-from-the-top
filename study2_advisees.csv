Look quickly for the available vowels in the game.  Then look for consonants that are adjacent to the vowels.  Try to scan the letters as quickly as possible to come up with words.  Keep a mental track of the words you have already identified, as you will not get credit for duplicate words.  Try to stay calm and not get flustered as the time ticks down.  Just keep scanning the letters in all directions looking for new words until time runs out.
